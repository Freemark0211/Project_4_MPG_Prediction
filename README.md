# Project_4_MPG_Prediction

## Project Description:
This project is to model and predict MPG (miles per gallon) using know vehicle specifications from a current EPA data set that ranged from 1984 to 2023 model years of US vehicles. After significant filtering and cleaning the data was visualized through Tableau and placed into a polynomial regression model. Then this model is used to predict expected MPG from vehicle specifications input through an interactive website.

## Tools and Methods Used:

- JavaScript

- Python:
	modules: Flask, Pandas, SciKitLearn

- Git collaboration

- Tableau

## ETL
